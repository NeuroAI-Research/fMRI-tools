## Usage

## Note

`fMRI` uses `EPI` to repeatedly acquire `BOLD`-sensitive `EPI volumes` over time, while `T1/T2-weighted` MRI provide high-resolution structural anatomy to align and interpret the functional data

- fMRI: functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
    - MRI used to measure brain function over time
- BOLD: Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (signal)
    - the contrast mechanism in fMRI reflecting changes in blood oxygenation linked to neural activity
- EPI: Echo Planar Imaging
    - a fast MRI acquisition method used to repeatedly capture BOLD-sensitive brain volumes for fMRI
- EPI volume
    - one 3D image acquired with EPI: a single time point ("snapshot") of BOLD-sensitive data
- T1-weighted (T1w)
    - longitudinal relaxation–weighted MRI
    - a high-resolution structural scan emphasizing anatomy (gray/white matter contrast)
- T2-weighted (T2w) 
    - transverse relaxation–weighted MRI
    - a structural scan emphasizing fluid, often used for pathology
